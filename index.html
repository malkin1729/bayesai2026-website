            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Following the workshops held at <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/24461">Dagstuhl in 2024</a> and <a href="https://bayesian.mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI in 2025</a>, the third workshop on <b>Rethinking the Role of Bayesianism in the Age Modern AI</b> will take place in Edinburgh in October 2026. This workshop will concurrently serve as the inaugural meeting of the <a href="https://bayesian.org/">International Society for Bayesian Analysis</a> section on Bayesian AI. 
                The gathering will bring together researchers exploring the frontiers of Bayesian machine learning and deep learning in a collaborative atmosphere.
            </p>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                Despite the recent success of AI systems using large-scale deep learning, these systems still fall short in terms of their reliability and trustworthiness. They often lack the ability to estimate their own uncertainty in a calibrated way, encode meaningful prior knowledge, avoid catastrophic failures, and reason about their environments to avoid such failures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bayesian deep learning has harboured the promise of achieving these desiderata by combining the statistical foundations of Bayesian inference with the practically successful engineering solutions of deep learning methods. However, compared to its promise, BDL methods often do not live up to expectations in terms of real-world impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                This workshop aims to rethink and redefine the promises and challenges of Bayesian approaches, elucidate which Bayesian methods might prevail against their non-Bayesian competitors, and identify key application areas where Bayes can shine. The event is planned to promote discussion in a collaborative atmorphere and encourage deep exchange, new ideas, and informal collaboration across intersecting areas of research.
